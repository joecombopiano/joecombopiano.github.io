                        Visible and public societal impact is the entirety of our endeavor. This platform encourages societal impact in every purchase by increasing transparency. Certifications and labels have become the equivalents of a pass/fail course; they reward a D- as much as an A+.  In our platform, we will drive business to A+ producers. This rewards them, and encourages other producers to innovate for competitive advantages.
                        <br><br>
                        Our quantitative successes will be reflected in the rise of plain statistics highlighted on the platform: E.g. Dollars paid per pound to a farmer, or percent of land under forest cover. We will know success as these numbers rise, reflecting consumers' decisions to support those operations with greatest impact.
                        <br><br>
                        Qualitative successes are the first-hand storytelling from the producers. Fundraisers have long known that a donor would rather "help a child in need" than "help the children". Our intimate connection can bring that same ethos to consumerism.
